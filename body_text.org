* Old Summary                                                      :noexport:
 - Tracking survey progress, comparison of survey progress to a baseline, and validation of scheduler assumptions are important for Rubin Observatory staff and management, the science collaborations, the astronomical community, funding agencies, and even the general public.
 - Survey progress and strategy diagnostics will need to be presented in multiple contexts, to a variety of audiences. Generation and presentation of such diagnostics will require multiple tools and processes.
 - Data useful for evaluating survey progress and optomizing strategy is best visualized in a variety of ways. Some useful metrics are best viewed as scalars, or a simple time series. In other cases, complex plots or diagrams are required, and even then such plots may only be effectively interpreted in combination with other plots, diagrams, or descriptive text.
 - Some metrics and visualizations needed for evaluating survey progress and optomizing strategy are "close to the data," and require minimal processing before presentation to the user. In other cases, significant analysis is necessary (for example suites of scheduler simulations). This diversity complicates infrastructure requirements.
 - Generation of survey progress and strategy diagnostics requires both data generated "close to the instrument" (telemetry from the telescope) and data only available from other sources such as the output of processing by Data Management and the results of strategy simulations.
 - Rubin Observatory infrastructure currently under development (including opsim, MAF, SQuaRE/SQuaSH, LOVE, the Engineering and Facilities Database (EFD), and the Data Management butler) provides or will provide an array data sources and visualzation tools. It is not always clear, however, which tools are a good match for which strategy and progress related metrics, and work is required take advantage of this existing infrastructure.

* Introduction

Once underway, a wide variety of people will have in interest in tracking the progress of Rubin Observatory in making the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).
In some cases, the interest is general, focused primarily on understading whether the project is living up to expectations.
Many others will have more specific interests.
Scientists who will be using the data need to understand what data is currently available, plan for what will be available in the future, and provide informed suggestions and feedback to the survey project. 
Members of the project itself will need to be able to identify problems and opportunities early, and adjust the survey's observing strategy accordingly.

Several Rubin Observatory planning documents recognize this need, and include related requirements:
 - [[https://ls.st/lse-29][LSE-29]], the "LSST System Requirments Document," requires that the project "provide periodic status reports on the progress of the survey to allow both operations staff and the community to assess the survey progress" (LSR-REQ-0065), "create the necessary survey performance evaluation tools to predict the final results of the ten year survey based on the actual survey completed to date, assess the impacts of survey strategy changes resulting from changes in scientific priorities, and support the planning of the survey on a variety of time scales, from nightly through the entire 10 year duration" (LSR-REQ-0066), and "monitor the scientific and technical progress of the survey, communicate with the scientific user community and establish survey priorities, and adjust the survey design as needed to accomplish its goals given these priorities and achieved performance" (LSR-REQ-0070). Furthermore, LSE-29 describes the role of an Observing Scientist who will need tools for oversight of the data collection process, including intervention in the normally autonomous operations process (LSR-REQ-0071).
 - [[https://ls.st/lse-30][LSE-30]], the "Observatory Systems Specifications," repeats the requirement that the project "provide the tools and administrative processes necessary to monitor the progress of the ongoing survey, provide reports on the progress of the survey, respond to feedback from the science community, and evaluate the impact of changing science priorities over the 10 year survey lifetime" (OSS-REQ-0033), and create summaries (OSS-REQ-131, OSS-REQ-0406), and publish visits ahead of observing them (OSS-REQ-0378). In addition, LSE-30 has several other requirements for monitoring that are of interest for scheduling and progress purposes (OSS-REQ-0056, 0067, 0068, 0072, 0078, 0079, 0314).
 - the [[https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-36797/Rubin%20Observatory%20Operations%20Plan%20April%202020.pdf][Rubin Observatory Operations Plan]] of April, 2020 states that the System Performance department will "Ensure that the observing strategy being implemented by the scheduler software is on track to achieve its science requirements at the end of 10 years. Achieving this goal will involve simulating the remaining survey time; folding in an evolving understanding of the Observatory system and ascertaining whether a change to the Scheduling algorithm or configuration may be warranted. In addition to meeting basic survey requirements, it may be possible to maximize the breadth of science that can be done with LSST by making minor changes to the observing strategy. The (internal) Survey Evaluation Working Group will include representation from Observatory Operations and Data Production, and will evaluate quarterly the current and expected performance of the survey and scheduler (as analyzed by the Survey Scheduling Team) and make recommendations to the Director on any needed tactical changes to the survey cadence (e.g., due to impact of weather, telescope or data processing responses to the schedule, etc)."

Although they emphasize the need for progress monitoring for strategy optimization and describe some reports in which such information is to be reported, they do not specify the specific data, metrics, or plots to be used for such monitoring or included in these reports.
The specific set of diagnostics will evolve over the course of the survey, but three sources can guide the generation of an initial set:
 - The formal requirments on the survey, for example as specified by LSE-29.
 - Metrics proposed by science collaborations for evaluation of survey strategy.
 - The experiences of precursor surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), in so far as there are relevant similarities between the surveys. Such experience can be useful both in what was these groups felt they did well, and what they wished they had done but did not.

 Progress and strategy diagnostics (metrics, plots, and other figures) are usefully characterized by several features:
 - Audience :: Different diagnostics and figures are useful to different audiences. Possible audiences include reviewers for and administrators of funding agencies, Rubin Observatory management, LSST science collaboration scientists, the Rubin Observatory Observatory Scientist, Observatory Support Scientists, Observing Specialists, Scheduler Scientists and Survey Software Engineers, astronomers working on other projects, other members of the astronomical community, and the general public. 
 - Format :: The diagnostics may take any of serveral forms, including simple scalars, time series and other plots, maps, or other represntations of distributions. 
 - Timing :: Diagnostics will need to be produced on range of timescale, ranging from hours to months. Some need to be produced shortly before or after each night of observing, or even periodically throughout the night. Others can be produced on a monthly schedule, or only in preparation for meetings and reviews.
 - Required data :: Data required to produce different diagnostics may originate in a variety of sources, including observatory telemetry, data products from Data Management, or sources outside the project (e.g. weather services).
 - Computing resources :: In some cases diagnostics can be produced with minimal calculation from available data sources. In other cases significant processing, up to and including suites of =opsim= simulations and corresponding calculation of metrics using =MAF=, will be required.

Each of these characteristics place requirements on the tools used to generate and provide access to the diagnostics.

* Use Cases
** Use Case Template                                               :noexport:
** Pre-night review

 - Purpose :: To catch potential problems with the scheduler before the night begins, and to inform the expectations of the night staff (observing specialists) so that they know when intervention is needed, or when experts need to be called for assistance during the night.
 - Context :: Before each night of observing, a plan for the night needs to be created and reviewed, and the observatory staff needs to be briefed about the night to come. The person supervising scheduling for the night will complete this use case, generating the necessary simulations and corresponding diagnostics needed to find problems with the scheduler and brief the observing specialists. The plots and diagnostics produced will also be used by the observing specialists during the night as a reference in supervising the scheduler.
 - Primary actor :: The person supervising scheduling for a specific night. The Rubin Observatory Operations Plan (2020), suggests that this will be the observatory scientist, although an observatory support scientist or scheduler scientist also seem consistant with that plan.
 - Other stakeholders :: The observatory scientist, observatory support scientists, observing specialists, survey scheduling team, and sometimes the survey evaluation working group.
 - Trigger :: A set time in the afternoon before a scheduled night of observing.
 - Success conditions :: Observing specialists and other night staff are prepared for the night, with the information and resources necessary to distinguish acceptable scheduler behavior from behavior requiring intervention or assistance from experts.
 - Main success scenario :: On most nights of routine observing:
   1. The scheduling supervisor for the night generates one or more simulated schedules for the night and a set of diagnostics on both the current state of the survey and the simulate schedules.
   2. The scheduling supervisor verifies that the simulated schedules are appropriate for night, given the current state of the survey.
   3. The scheduling supervisor uses the generated plots and other diagnostics to brief the observing specialists on the expected behaviour of the scheduler during the night.
   4. Observing proceeds, and the observing specialists verify that the scheduler is behaving according to expectations set in the briefing, using the generated plots and diagnostics as references.
 - Variant scenarios :: The scheduling supervisor or observing specialists may detect anomalies or incorrect behaviour in either steps 2 or 4. Further diagnostics and exploration may be required, but the specific requirements will vary considerably, and are outside the scope of this use case. Experts on the scheduling team may be contacted for assistance. Once any issues have been resolved, the set of night diagnostics may be regenerated for verification.

** Night Reports
 - Purpose :: To alert the observatory scientists,  scheduling team, survey evaluaton working group, and other experts on scheduling to potential problems requiring attention. To keep Rubin Observatory staff, science collaborations, and others interested in the state of Rubin Observatory and the progress on LSST up to date.[fn:: The night summaries have many purposes beyond these, beyound the scope of this document.]
 - Context :: At the end of each night, observatory staff will produce a summary of the night. Information on the progress of the survey during the night and diagnostics for the sceduler and related systems will be included in these summaries.
 - Primary actor :: The observing specialists on duty at the end of the night will be responsible for producing the night summary.
 - Other stakeholders :: All readers of the night summary, including but not limited to the observatory scientist and other staff, project management, subsystem specialists, data management staff, science working group members, and interested members of the general public.
 - Trigger :: The end of a night of observing.
 - Success conditions :: Any project members who might need to respond to events during the night have the resources needed to quickly and easily determine if their attention is required, and a starting point for doing so. Scientists interested in LSST data can quickly determine if data of interest to them was collected on the previous night. Management is aware of persistent night-time operations problems, and can direct resources accordingly. New observing specialists and others in training can get a sense of what current normal observing is like, and what they can expect, and current (already trained) observing staff is aware of any changes or problems they will need to look out for.
 - Main success scenario :: There are many variations on the "night summary" use case. A typical one would proceed as follows:
   1. At the end of the night, the observing specialsts generate a draft night summary using tools which mostly automate the process.
   2. The observing specialists review the draft night summary, revising and providing text commentary when necessary.
   3. The observing specialists make the night summary available (as a web page, on an RSS feed, by email, or by some other method).
   4. In the morning, the a scheduler scientist reviews the night summary, verifying that the scheduler behaved as expected, with the expected resulting data, and that other subsystems behaved as expected by the models used in the scheduler.
 - Variant scenarios :: Different readers of the night summary will look for different kinds of information. Subsystems experts will follow up on any anomalies seen, usually with more general purpose tools. Data management staff will use information in the night summary to inform supervision of automated data processing, and prevent or resolve any problems the might occurr while rudecing the data. Many others may simply read the night summary to keep current on how the observing is going, and so the night summary becomes a mechanism for maintaining interest. Regularly updated and accessible progress plots are particularly valuable for helping collaborators and potential collaborators remain engaged.

** Survey Progress Reports
 - Purpose :: To communicate the current survey progress to Rubin Observatory management, the science collaborations and other members of the astronomical community. To convey an understanding of the reasons for deviation from expected progress, and the long term impact of unexpected events and changes in plans to expectations of future progress and the final state of the survey. Data and presentation should be sufficient to elicit informed survey strategy related feedback and recommendations from the scientific community, and direction from the survey evaluation working group (SEWG), survey cadence optimization committee (SCOC), and other elements of Rubin Observatory management.
 - Context :: Each quarter (according to the 2020 Rubin Operations Plan), the observatory support scientists will produces a report presenting and discussing the current progress on the survey, and any revised expectations of future progress.
 - Primary actor :: The observatory support scientists.
 - Other stakeholders :: Rubin Observatory management, scheduler scientists, survey evaluation working group (SEWG), survey cadence optimization committee (SCOC), and science collaborations.
 - Trigger :: Calendar date (quarterly).
 - Success conditions :: Observatory management has an overall understanding of the state of the survey sufficient to direct resources and report to funding agencies. The science collaborations have the the data and analysis needed to provide informed feedback and suggestions to the project. The survey evaluation working group (SEWG) and survey cadence optimization committee (SCOC) have the data and explanations they need to identify needed changes and evaluate changes to survey strategy.
 - Main success scenario :: In the primary success scenario, under which the survey has progressed roughly according to the expectations of the observatory support scientists and scheduling team.:
   1. Near the end of a quarter, an observatory support scientists collect the latest plots and diagnostics describing the state of the survey, and compiles them into a document with accompanying text describing how the achieved weather conditions (seeing, weather, atmospheric extinction) compared with expectations for the site, how instrumental and procedural performance compared with expectations, and the impact of any differences on survey progress. They also include the results of simulations starting with the current state and extending through the end of the survey.
   2. The scheduling scientists review the draft report, and supplement it with additional plots or commentary if necessary.
   3. The completed report is distributed to Rubin Observatory management, survey evaluation working group (SEWG), survey cadence optimization committee (SCOC), and science collaborations.
   4. Science collaborations review the report, and prepare responses, if necessary.[fn: The procedure for submitting, evaluating, and responding to such responses is beyond the scope of this document, but the quality of the progress reports will drive the quality of these responses.]
 - Variant scenarios :: Significant deviations from expected progress will result in a variety of different sequences, depending on the details of the deviations. For example:
   + poor weather :: If the quarter had a month of very poor weather, such that the last month passed without collection of any useful data, scenario might proceed as follows:
     1. The initial compilation and distribution of the draft proceeds as described in the main scenario steps 1 through 3, except for the addition of additional discussion related to the weather, and independent evaluation of the parts of the quarter in which the weather was more normal (to verify that other problems did not also contribute to the lack of progress). Differences between the previous and current project progress will be called out in the discussion.
     2. Science collaboration propose changes in response to the unexpected lack of progress. For example, if the month of poor weather occurred near the end of a DDF season, some science collaborations interested in the DDF may wish to propose that the remaining DDF visits in the season be replaced by denser coverage of DDFs in later seasons, because any additional DDFs in the current season would be too isolated in time to be scientifically useful.
   + underperforming filter :: Consider a case in which the visits from one filter have been shallower than expected, with the result that the accumulated number of exposures in each filter is as expected, but the accumulated coadded depth is shallower than expected.
     1. The initial compilation and distribution of the draft proceeds as described in the main scenario steps 1 through 3, except for the addition of additional discussion related to factors effecting visit depth in the lagging filter, including clouds, sky brightness, and seeing at the times during which the images were taken and inferred throughput of the instrument, together with inferences concerning whether these conditions are likely to continue into th future. For example, z and y band might lag if the seeing happened to have been unusually poor during bright time, but seeing is not expected to correlate with the moon long term except by coincidence, so if this were the cause it would be unlikely to continue into the future. On the other hand, if the sky brightness in these filters were consistently significantly brighter than the model, then this would indicate a problem with the model, and one might infer that these filters would continue to fall further behind. In any case, the authors of the report would discuss the long term impact of the lagging filter, including final coadd depth, detection efficiency for different transients, and progress as measured in other science metrics, in both the long and short term.
     2. The science collaborations review the report, and decide whether alterations in strategy might be required to mitigate its effects. For example, if an underperforming z band were found to be the limiting factor in photometric redishift measurements, and r and i band getting deeper visits than expected, the photometric redshift working group may propose changing the balance between numbers of visits in the different bands, replacing r and i band visits with z band visits. The plots and metrics in the report should support estimation of how many visits would have to be moved from r and i to z, and what impact this might have on final coadd depth.

** Science project planning (static)
 - Purpose :: To determine when (or if) survey coadd data will be useful for a science project requiring a certain area at a certain depth.
 - Context :: A small group of astronomers comes up with a brilliant idea for a project, and conclude that they need a survey that covers at least 10000 square degrees and has $5-\sigma$ limiting magnitudes of at least 26.0 in r and 25.0 in z. They want to know when Rubin Observatory might have collected the necessary data to construct such coadds. 
 - Primary actor :: Astronomers planning a project.
 - Trigger :: A group of astronomers has an inspiration for a project.
 - Success conditions :: A collaboration of astronomers have a good understanding of when their project will become feasable, or to what degree.
 - Main success scenario :: The group might take the following steps:
   1. The astronomers retrieve plots of $t_{\mbox{eff}}$ vs. calendar date for the filters for relevance from a recent night report or qualterly report.
   2. They note that in most years, the slope of accumulated $t_{\mbox{eff}}$ followed the baseline, but there was one year during which progress was more shallow, after which it returned to the nominal slope.
   3. They estimate the date on which the $t_{\mbox{eff}}$ correspends to the magnitudes of interest for each filter, extrapolating from the latest point by eye, using the typical slope. They also use the maximum and minimum slopes (visually obvious from inspection of the plot) to estimate optimistic and pessimistic dates on which the data might have been collected.
** Mini-survey evaluation
 - Purpose :: To estimate the effectiveness of an ongoing target of opportunity program (or other minisurvey), and its impact on the progress made on WFD science goals and other mini-surveys.
 - Context :: Current plans dedicate a fraction of Rubin Observatory observing time to mini-surveys. Estimation of the impact of these surveys on the WFD and other programs will not always be straightforward: visits scheduled for them will often also contribute to WFD goals, so even though the time taken for them may not be fully optimal for WFD science, it is not fully lost to it either. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the mini-survey must itself be evaluated for how well it progressing towards its own scientific goals. If it is making little progress but having a significant impact on WFD progress, the mini-survey observing strategy may need to be modified, or the mini-survey discontinued.
 - Primary actor :: the survey cadence optimization committee (SCOC)
 - Trigger :: Regular meeting of the SCOC.
 - Success conditions :: The SCOC has the data necessary to make informed decisions on renewing mini-surveys.
 - Main success scenario ::
   1. The SCOC examines the most recent survey progress report and reports from the science collaborations on status of the science from the mini-survey.
   2. By comparing WFD science metrics actually achieved to those that opsim simulations report would have happened had the mini-survey not taken place, the SCOC detemines whether the mini-survey's impact on the FWD was well estimated, or if it was more or less disruptive than expected. 
   3. The SCOC recommends the continuance, alteration, or conclusion of the mini-survey. For example, it may apply additional conditions on a target of opportunity mini-survey if triggered visits were less useful for the FWD than had been expected. Alternately, if a mini-survey has been under-prefroming on its own scientific metrics, but alterations to survey strategy have had little or no impact on WFD science goals, the SCOC may recommend that the minisurvey be expanded.
* Metrics, plots, and other diagnostics
** Survey state descriptions
Figures and diagrams describing the current "state of the survey" will be of great interest to the community as a whole, and providing an understanding of whether or not they correspond to the plan for the survey will be essential for explaining how well the survey is proceeding.
Examples of such diagrams will include:

 - depth maps :: Maps of the survey showing the numbers of total visits, numbers of visits in each filter, and coadd limiting magnitude in each filter are likely to be the most prominant figures that show the current state of the survey. Current tools for evaluation of survey simulations produce examples of such plots, and [[http://astro-lsst-01.astro.washington.edu:8081/allMetricResults?runId=392#Basic%20Maps][results pages]] show examples of such maps for the end of simulated surveys. Maps cut in an assortment of ways, for example including only visits with PSF widths narrower than some cutoff, may also be of interest. Figure [[fig:depthmap]] shows an example of a depth map produced by MAF, for the end of a baseline survey. 
 - depth/area plot :: A plot of the total area on the sky covered by the survey as a function of minimum depth will also be a useful representation of progress. Figure [[fig:deptharea]] shows an example of such a plot produced by MAF, for the end of a baseline survey. When used to show survey progress, reference curves from a baseline simulation should be included as well.
 - filter use hourglass plots :: A single graphic that shows the distribution of filter use by time of night and year, and in relation to the moon, can indicate whether dark time is being used efficiently. The [[http://astro-lsst-01.astro.washington.edu:8081/allMetricResults?runId=392#Hourglass][results pages]] give examples of such plots for the ends of simulated surveys. Figure [[fig:filterhourglass]] shows an example of such a plot produced by MAF, for the end of a baseline survey.
 - time use hourglass plots :: A single graphic that summarizes how time has been used by the survey so far will also be of wide interest. A plot will be a similar appearance to that of filter use hourglass plots, and like the plot will indicate time of year on one spatial axis and time of night on the other. Instead of indicating filter, however, this hourglass plot would indicate whether the pointing being observed corresponds to the FWD survey, a mini survey, or (if not science observing) what other activity was taking place. Likely categories to by symbolized by colors include: down time due to equipment failure, down time due to regular maintenance or engineering, time closed due weather, time open and observing but without useful exposures (e.g. due to thick clouds), time spent on observations outside the WFD footprint (possibly separated by mini-survey), time spent on DDFs, and other time in the WFD.
 - data quality hourglass plots :: A plot similar to the filter and time use hourglass plots, but uses the color coding to represent data quality (as measured by $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude relative to nominal depth or $t_{\mbox{eff}}$[fn: $t_{\mbox{eff}} \equiv 10^{\frac{4}{5}(m_{\mbox{lim}} - m_{0})}$, where $m_{0}$ is some reference limiting magnitude. $t_{\mbox{eff}} has two advantages over the more traditional limiting magnitude: first, it scales linearly with time under similar conditions, and second, it is additive under coaddition.]).
 - transient detection efficiency maps :: Maps of detection efficiency for different classes of variable objects (bright and faint near Earth objects (NEOs), TransNeptunian Objects (TNOs), Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs), fast microlensing events, type 1a supernovae, and others) over the footprint, for the entire survey so far and for the current season.[fn:: Gaps between seasons may be defined to be gaps between visits than include the date on which the sun has the same R.A. as the point on the sky.]
 - deep drilling field (DDF) cadence plots :: A set of plots (one for each DDF) showing the nights on which each DDF has been observed in the current season, and marking the time since it was last observed in each filter. Such plots may also encode the depth of exposures in each band on each night. Figure [[fig:snhistory]] shows a sample cadence plot made using simulated data.
 - DDF transient efficienty plots ::  The detection efficiency and actual numbers of detections for different classes of transients may be plotted as a function of date for each DDF. If these plots were combined with the DDF cadence plots, these plots may also guide an intuition for how gaps of different sizes affect the science for different classes of objects.

#+CAPTION: A mock-up of an LSST DDF cadence plot, made using the version 1.7 baseline. Each subplot shows the cadence of a DDF field. The colors of the bars at each date represent different filters, and the heights of each color in each bar represents the combined effective exposure time, $t_{\mbox{eff}} = 10^{\frac{4}{5} \times (m5_{lim}-m_{0})}$, on that night in that filter, so that limiting magnitude of a coadded exposures from that night in that filter is $m5_{\mbox{lim}} = m_{0} + \frac{5}{4} \log t_{\mbox{eff}}$.  In addition to the features shown in this mock-up, it would also be useful to show the nights of full moon, closest approach of the moon to each field, nights closed due to weather and other downtime, and time since the last set of visits deeper than some reference limiting magnitude.

** Time series progression of scalar survey metrics
Many science metrics are expected to improve continuously over the course of the survey.
For each metric, there are two and perhaps three quantities that can be usefully compared:
 - baseline :: the value of the metric for the given time, as measured frllom a reference simulation.
 - estimated :: the value of the metric for the given time, measured from the actually collected visits and visit parameters in the same way they were measured against the baseline simulation.
 - achieved :: the value of the metric as mearused from the final processed data products.

Estimated and achieved may differ in cases where the metric ultimately depends on the final catalogues of objects, which can only be estimated using the simple list of visits and data quality parameters produced by =opsim=.
One example of this would be the total number of stars and galaxies detected (PSTN-51 sections 3.3 and 3.6): errors and limited precision in the model for the distribution of stars and galaxies will result in a difference between the estimated and achieved values of the metric.

 - Total, mean, median, min, max, and quantiles of numbers of visits :: Table 23 of [[http://ls.st/lpm-17][LPM-17]], "The LSST System Science Requirements Document," gives specifications for the "sum of the median number of visits in each band, Nv1, across the sky area". Additional statistics beyond the median are also indicative of the quality of the survey: highly skewed distributions, long tails to the distribution, or a significant difference between the mean and median could all indicate problems in scheduling. Good candidates for showing the time series of this distributions would be a time series boxplot or violin plot. See figure [[fig:nvboxplot]] for a sample created from the run 1.7 baseline simulation. 
 - Numbers of science visits by band :: In addition to the sum across all bands, the distributions of visits in each band individually, and relative to each other, are also good indicators of whether the scheduler is behaving as expected. Time series plots of the visits split by band should rougly a constant proportionality on a timescale of months, but differences within each lunation, due to filters being swapped out and redder filters being preferentially chosen when the moon is very bright. Figure [[fig:progressbyband]] shows a sample of what such a figure might look like, except that a production instances would show both the baseline and actual values for comparison.
 - Numbers of science visits by R.A. :: Because the visibility of areas of the sky varies with the time of year, the distribution of visits across the sky is not expected to be uniform. Ideal visibility varies with R.A., so if the survey is ultimately to be uniform, the calendar observing dates elapsed and remaining need to corresponding rougly to the distribution of completed and needed visits for uniformity across the footprint. Plots of the number of visits in a set of R.A. bins as a function of date should show clear jumps at times when those R.A.'s correspond to local Sidereal times (LSTs) during the night in those times of year. Figure [[fig:progressbyquarter]] shows a sample of what such a figure might look like, except that a production instances would show both the baseline and actual values for comparison.
 - Numbers of science visits by program :: The fraction of time dedicatated to the Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) survey and mini-surveys (including the Deep Drilling Fields (DDFs), Galactic Plane (GP), North Ecliptic Spur (NES), South Celestial Pole (SEP), and Target of Opportunity observations (ToOs)) will be specified as part the establishment of survey strategy, and whether the scheduler is adhering to these decisions should be monitored.
 - Science collaboration metrics :: [[https://ls.st/pstn-051][PSTN-51]], "Survey Strategy and Cadence Choices for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)," specifies a set of metrics contributed by the LSST science collaborations, including:
   + detection completeness for different classes of transients and moving objects
   + numbers of stars and galaxies
   + the dark energy 3x2 Figure of Merit (FoM)
   Supplements and refinements to these metrics are expected.

** Projected scalar metrics for the final survey as a function of time
Many survey metrics do not improve uniformly or even smoothly with time.
For example, the accumulated visits will be spread roughly uniformly over the survey footprint at any given time, so the area of sky observed to the nominal depth (specified in table 22 of [[http://ls.st/lpm-17][LPM-17]]) will remain near zero for most of the survey, and then rise rapidly at the end: simply tracking the area covered to the nominal depth as a function of time does not provide a useful indication of progress being made toward achieving this metric.
Progress toward achieving this requirement can, however, be tracked using simulations: if the remainder of the survey is simulated after each night of observing and the final metrics measured using the final result, the time series can be plotted to indicate how much progress the survey is making in comparison with what is required.
A flat horizontal line will indicate a survey progressing exactly as expected based on simulations.
A rising line will indicate that the survey is making more progress than expected, while a falling one indicates that the survey is falling behind.

The final area is not the only metric for which these simulations are good tools for indicating progress; all of the scalar science metrics can be plotted in the same way. Plotting a selection of such metrics can show whether the current conditions or startegy are favoring some science goals over others in unexpected ways.
The list of metrics tracked this way should be the same as that in section [[*Time series progression of scalar survey metrics]].

** Nightly scheduler behaviour diagnostics
A number of plots and metrics will be needed to provide useful diagnostic information that can either help explain or predict the scheduler's behaviour, or identify potential problems in it.

These metrics can be usefully tracked at two times:
 - start of night :: At least one =opsim= simulation should be run for the night before each night of observing. Nightly scheduler behaviour diagnostics should be calculated for these simulations, giving an indication of what is expected for the night, and providing advanced warning for any unexpected or anamolous behaviour. Nights of observing do not always proceed according to plan: slight differences in the start time or overhead between exposures may cause the predicted and actual schedule to diverge, and closures due to poor weather or equipment failure may create greater disruption. A handful of simulations with random offsets in start times and overheads between exposures can indicate the range of possibilities.[fn:: If the scheduler is modified to respond to observing conditions, then a handful of weather conditions will need to be simulated as well.]
 - end of night :: Nightly scheduler diagnostics should be calculated for each night shortly after the completion of observing. These diagnostics will alert the project to any scheduler problems or misbehaviour during the night, and help explain the scheduler's behaviour when it was not intuitive.

Examples of such diagnostics include:
 - Astronomical maps :: Diagrams resembling planispheres (e.g. shown in figure [[fig:planisphere]] are helpful for understanding what parts of the survey footprint are available, which DDF fields might be observed and when, and the degree to which the moon will be a factor in scheduling. Such diagrams do not themselves present progress or scheduler information, but the do provide valuable context in which other scheduler diagnostics should be evaluated. 
 - Feature maps :: Modern version of =opsim= select visits (or sets of visits grouped into "blobs") based on "features" that are functions of location on the sky: the slew time to reach the location on the sky, the expected depth of exposures to be taken there, and the progress made so far on that portion of the sky. A weighted mean of these features determines the selection of the next visit or set of visits. Examination of maps of these visits and the resultant final reward function is therefore fundamental to understanding the scheduler's behaviour. The presentation of the feature maps is complicated by the variablity with time and dependence on current pointing. It may be most useful simply to exclude the slew time feature, which depends on the current pointing. Two candidate formats may be useful for dealing with the time variability:
   + animation :: a movie of the map over the night will provide the most detail, but can be difficult to navigate.
   + maximum feature values :: maps of the maximum value each point on the sky takes over the course of the night will be a useful indicator of how likely the scheduler is to schedule visits in these areas at some point in the night.
 - Full table of scheduled visits :: To support coordination between Rubin Observatory and other projects, [[https://ls.st/lse-61][LST-61]]/DMS-REQ-0353 requires that "A service shall be provided to publish to the community the next visit location and the predicted visit schedule provided by the OCS. This service shall consist of both a web page for human inspection and a web API to allow automated tools to respond promptly." Such a table (in both forms) will be useful not only to external projects, but also to the observing scientists: although on most nights the scientist will not need to consult the table, it will sometimes be useful as a reference for exploring the details of expect from the upcomming night when higher level depictions of the night are unexpected or confusing.
 - Pointing movie :: A movie of the pointings of the telescope over the course of the night will be one of the fastest ways to convey an understanding of what the scheduler will do (before the night) or did (after it). Superposition of the pointings over the feature map would also help understand scheduler behaviour.
 - Global observing efficiency :: The ratio of the total science exposure time to the available time (measured using morning and evening twilight as references) provides a good, gross indicator of whether the scheduler is scheduling visits efficiently (minimizing overhead time).
 - Gap distribution :: A histogram of the gaps in time between successive visits can indicate where inefficiencies in observing come from.
 - Table of long gaps :: Long gaps between exposures indicated either problems or inefficiencies. A short table of unusually long gaps between pairs of exposure with possible indicators of explanations (e.g. the slew angle between exposures, or whether there was a filter change) can call attention to this lost time for evaluation by a human.
 - H.A. distribution :: The distribution of hour angles for scheduled exposures indicates whether the scheduler is maximizing data quality.
 - DDF cadence plots :: The DDF cadence plots described in section [[*Survey state descriptions]] will also be important for understanding whether a DDF should be (or should have been) observed on a given night.
 - Fraction of time in blobs :: The "blob" scheduler is intended to be the workhorse scheduler for the WFD, and if an unexpectedly large number of exposures are being scheduled by the geedy scheduler, it may indicate a problem.

** Validation of the site and telescope model
=opsim= simulations rely on several models for the characteristics of the site and the performance of the instrument.
Deviations from the models can have significant consequences for the accuracy of the simulations.
Comparisons between the modeled and achieved characteristics of the site and instrument will be important not only for understanding deviations between simulated and achieved performance, but also for improving simulations and making corresponding refinements to survey strategy.

For each modeled feature, there are at least two plots are of interest: one plots the measured values against the value calculated by the =opsim= model; and the other that tracks the distribution of residuals over time (for example a box or violin plot).
In some cases, additional plots may also be important.

Examples of modeled characteristics include:
 - slew time :: In addition to simple compaing the modeled to achieved slew time, residuals between the two can be shown as a function of horizon coordinates and rotator angle.
 - filter change time :: Nominally 90 seconds plus up to 30 seconds to put the camera into the necessary position.
 - shutter time :: Nominally 1 second of overhead per visit.
 - readout time :: Nominally 2 seconds, in parallel with any slew time.
 - total overhead between successive exposures :: In principle the total overhead can be calculated by combining each source of overhead, but measurements of the total time from one exposure to the next (the start of of one visit to the start time of the next) will be an important diagnositic for discovering if the different values combine as expected, and if there are additional sources of overhead that have not been accounted for.
 - sky brightness :: The sky brightness as a function of airmass, sun and moon location and phase, filter, and other factors. Plots that show residuals with respect to horizon coordinates may also be useful for indicating limitations in the model due to light polution, which is not currently included in the model.
 - atmospheric seeing :: =opsim='s simulation is based on achived data from the Gemini South DIMM. A comparison of the Gemini South and Rubin Observatory DIMM measurements will provide a diagnostic for resultanting limitations. 
 - final delivered PSF width :: The final delivered PSF width is a function of the atmospheric seeing, filter, airmass, the turbulance outer scale, dome seeing, and other instrumental contributions. In some cases, the value used by the =opsim= model is highly uncertain (e.g. the turbulence outer scale). Other contributers (for example the effect of the strength and direction relative to the telescope pointing on the dome seeing) are not currently modeled at all.
 - extinction and lost time due to clouds :: The modules used for strategy simulation by =opsim= are based on historical cloud data recorded by humans at the nearby Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The correspondence between these estimates and actual time lost is highly uncertain. 
 - time lost due to engineering activities and equipment failures ::
 - achieved depth :: The expected $5 \sigma$ limiting magnitude for point source detections in each visit is one of the basic "features" used by the scheduler, and is affected by a variety of factors. Comparisons between estimated and achieved depth are therefore of fundamental importance. 

While some of these characteristics are functions of others, independent measurement of each will be important for verifying that the relations are those that are expected, and that there are no significant unaccounted for contributions.

In many cases, these characteristics will be tracked as part of telescope operations, independent of direct strategy considerations.
However, tracking and maintaining survey strategy requires presentation in a way that supports easy comparison to and updating of the =opsim= models.
Either the tracking and monitoring being done for other systems should include the necessary comparisons to the =opsim= models, or separate variations should be generated for the Scheduling Scientists and Survey Software Engineers.

** Disruption consequence analysis
The project will need to be able to quantify the consequences of departures from the baseline strategy, both in advance and in retrospect. 
Possible causes of disruptions include "target of opportunity" observing, unexpected engineering downtime, and observing in a degraded state (e.g. with a broken raft). 
It some cases, the ultimate consequences for the science will not always be immediately obvious.
For example, a set of target of opportunity exposures will not necessarily result in complete loss of time for the WFD or other programs, because exposures scheduled for the ToO will often contribute to the FWD themselves. 
To quantify the effects of such disruptions, achieved metrics need to be compared to what they would have been without the disruptions.
This comparison requires additional simulations.
By comparing metrics derived from simulations in which the discruption never takes place with ones in which they did, both the immediate and long term effects of the disruption can be quantified.
The details of what simulations are needed for the comparison depend on whether the disruption being analyzed is one that has already occurred, or one which is under consideration or expected.
When evaluating possible future disruptions, the simulations for comparison are both simulations from the current time to the completion of the survey, differing only by whether or not the disruption occurs.
When evaluating the effects of a past disruption, the reference simulation (the one without the disruption) must begin in the past, before the disruption, and be run with the same environmental parameters (e.g. clouds and seeing) as actually achieved.
That way, the consequences of the disruption itself can be evaluated independentely of deviations between the simulated and actual survey.

In both cases, short and long term differences are of interest.
Two disruptions may have similar short-term effects on metrics, but some disruptions will be easier for the automatic scheduler to automatically recover from with future observations than others.
The time and degree to which it will be possible to recover from the disruption will sometimes be important information.

* Tools, reports, and their users
** Introduction
The Rubin Observatory project and staff performing LSST will require survey progress and status diagnostics, including a variety of metrics and plots.
Some of these will be needed by the staff themselves, providing the data needed to prevent and diagnose problems, identify potential imporvements, and evaluate suggestions for changes.
In addition, such plots and metrics will also be needed for reports to the astronomical community and funding agencies, and even may be useful in engaging the general public.

The infrastructure suitable for producing such plots and metrics depend of several factors, including the audience expected to make use of them and the frequency with which they need to be produced.
Full automation of the production of plots and metrics will be most important when they need to be produced frequently, on a nightly or monthly basis.
When their audience includes non-experts, either full automation or simple production on demand will save effort.
Plots that are used primarily for debugging or exploration of specific issues may not require the same level of automation or simplicty of interface, but tools for reproduction of previous example of such diagnostics can be important for avoiding duplication of effort.

These plots and metrics can be produced and presented in any of several ways:

 - Interactive tools :: When developing and debugging the software, hardware, and human procedures that produce the survey, experts working on the project require flexible tools to obtain and explore the relevant data. Planning and prediction of the consequences of events and choices will often benefit creation of simulations. Examples of such sets of tools (e.g. =opsim= and =MAF=) have been developed as part of project construction, and will continue to perform an important role in operations. General tools designed for monitoring other aspects of the survey (e.g. the health of the instrument or the status of data processing) will also have important roles to play. 
 - Information dashboards :: Some plots and metrics will routine production and monitoring, often by those who are not expert users of the interactive tools like =MAF=. Even for those who do have the expertise, automation of the production of routine plots and metrics will save significant effort. Infrastructure that generates needed plots and metrics and presents them in a simple way (e.g. an automatically update web page, or small collection of web pages) will therefore be important. This infrastructure will require many of the same software components used by the interactive tools, plus some automation and presetation elements. 
 - Reports :: The project will need to produce reports covering survey status and progress, whether in the form of documents and presentations. Many of the plots and metrics displayed in an information dashboard will be important elements in these reports. 

The intended audience and the frequency of reporting are both important feature to consider in determining how any given metric or plot is to be generated.
Possible audiences include the funding agencies, Rubin Observatory management, LSST science collaboration scientists, the Observatory Science team (including the Observatory Scientist), the Observing Specialists, the Observatory Support Scientists, the Scheduler Scientists, Survey Software Engineers, astronomers working on other projects, other members of the astronomical community, and the general public. 
Plots and metrics may be generated on regular schedules (nightly, monthly, or quarterly), or as occasions demand.

The LSST system and data management requirements ([[https://ls.st/lse-29][LSE-29]] and [[https://ls.st/lse-61][LSE-61]]) and observatory systems specifications ([[https://ls.st/lse-30][LSE-30]]) include requirements on several reports and reporting tools. The roles and activities in the [[https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-36797/Rubin%20Observatory%20Operations%20Plan%20April%202020.pdf][Rubin Observatory Operations Plan]] imply additional reports, and imply additional requirements on those already described.

** Night Plan

Potential problems related to strategy or scheduling should be found and resolved before each night of observing, of possible, and the observing specialists on shift during the night need to be briefed and provided with a written plan describing any unusual activities or modes of operation, what they should expect of the scheduler, what behaviour they should consider anomalous, and how they should react to anomalous behaviour.
The [[https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-36797/Rubin%20Observatory%20Operations%20Plan%20April%202020.pdf][Rubin Observatory Operations Plan]] gives responsibility for reviewing and supervising scheduler behaviour to the Observatory Scientist and the Observatory Support Scientists, but specific procedures for this review and the briefing of the observing specialists are not yet developed.
Under any plan it would be worthwhile to automate the generation of the necessary scheduler simulations and diagnostics (listed in section [[*Nightly scheduler behaviour diagnostics]]) for review and inclusion in briefing for the observing specialists and a plan for the night.

In operations rehearsals (summarized in [[https://dmtn-119.lsst.io][DMTN-119]] and [[https://dmtn-159.lsst.io/][DMTN-159]]), each night was planned in a daily meeting which included the current status and plans for the next night.
Among the "lessons learned" described in DMTN-119 was the need for a good note-taking during the daily meeting, with status report elements filled in prior to the meeting itself. 
The minutes of this meeting can then become a plan for the night.
Infrastructure to automate the creation of these report elements could either present them using a dashboard-like interface and be incorporated into the minutes, or create a template night plan directly, then supplemented during the meeting.[fn:: This process is similar to that used for observing for the Dark Energy Survey (DES).]

Automation in support of the night plan should include:
 - Automatic creation of one or more scheduler simulations.[fn:: A side-effect of the creation of scheduler simulations completed in the afternoon is the creation of one or more candidate schedules. If these are produced in format that can be uploaded to the OCS, they can serve as a back-up to the scheduler in the unlikely event of a catastrophic failure of the scheduler during the night.]
 - Automatic creation of the diagnostics listed in section [[*Nightly scheduler behaviour diagnostics]], based on the simulations.
 - Presentation of the diagnostics a dashboard, automatically generated static report, or as part of a template observing plan for the night.

** Published upcomming schedule
To support coordination between LSST observing and that of other projects, including schedling of simultaneous or nearly simultaneous exposures the same areas of sky, the requirments specify that Rubin Observatory publish the observing schedule in advance.

One requirement that specifies the advanced schedule is [[https://ls.st/lse-61][LST-61]]/DMS-REQ-0353, "Publishing predicted visit schedule":
#+begin_quote
Specification: A service shall be provided to publish to the community the next visit location and the predicted visit schedule provided by the OCS. This service shall consist of both a web page for human inspection and a web API to allow automated tools to respond promptly.

Discussion: The next visit and advanced schedule do not need to be published using the same service or protocol.
#+end_quote
another is [[https://ls.st/lse-30][LSE-30]]/OSS-REQ-0378, "Advanced Publishing of Scheduler Sequence":
#+begin_quote
The scheduling of the observing sequence lasting at least =schedSeqDuration= shall be published in advance of each observing visit.
#+end_quote

These requirments imply the infrastructure necessary for:
 - Automatic creation of scheduler simulations. The initial simulation for the night may be the same one as that described in section [[*Night Plan]], but additional simulations throughout the night will also be required. 
 - A service to publish the predicted schedule through a web API.
 - A service te publish the predicted schedule on a web page suitable for human inspection. 

The overlap between these requiremnts and those for the creation of a night plan suggests that the same tool be used for both uses. 
Support for this use case imposes several additional requirements not present for the night plan:
 - The published schedule and diagnostics must be available to the public, not just the project staff.
 - Update schedules need to be published as necessary though the night, not just at the start of the each night.
 - A web API suitable for support of automated tools must be supplied.

** Night reports
Night reports (or nights summaries) are in important feature common to most astronomical facilities, and basic plots and metrics indicating survey progress are important elements for such reports in large surveys such as LSST.
Several Rubin Observatory requirements require specify different aspects of the content and creation of night reports, including LSE-30/OSS-REQ-0131, LSE-30/OSS-REQ-0406, LSE-61/DMS-REQ-0096, and LSE-61/DMS-REQ-0097. Section 1.4 of LST-490, the "Observatory Electronics Logging Working Group Report," acknowledges the need for infrastructure to support the creation of this report.
The specifications require that the report summarize "per system performance and behavior," but do not specify what is to be reported in great detail.
This report is a natural home for the nightly scheduler behaviour diagnostics (described in section [[*Nightly scheduler behaviour diagnostics]]), when applied to actual (as opposed to simulated) scheduled nights.
Furthermore, some elements of the survey state description (section [[*Survey state descriptions]]) will be of broad enough interest that updates to them may be usefully included after each night.

In addition to the diagnostics directly related to scheduling, several of the data quality indicators that will be reported in the night report (following LSE-61/DMS-REQ-0097) to monitor the health of other subsystems are close to those needed for validation of the scheduler's site and telescope model (section [[*Validation of the site and telescope model]]). If these elements are produced with the needs of the scheduler scientists in mind, these same plots may fill both needs.

So, to support scheduler and survey progress monitoring, the night report should include:
 - Comparisons of system characteristics (slew time, filter change time, depth, sky brightness, etc.) with models used by the scheduler simulator (some subset of the diagnostics listed in section [[*Validation of the site and telescope model]]).
 - Nightly scheduler behaviour diagnostics (most or all diagnostics listed in section [[*Nightly scheduler behaviour diagnostics]]). 
 - Updated diagnostics for the survey state (a selection of the diagnostics listed in section [[*Survey state descriptions]]).

 #+end_quote

** Tools for performance evaluation and analysis
The Observatory Scientist, Observatory Support Scientists, and the Survey Scheduling team will need to routinely monitor survey progress and assumptions at a more detailed level than supported by the night reports alone:
detailed monitoring will require all diagnostics listed in section [[*Metrics, plots, and other diagnostics]].
Furthermore, additional diagnostics will be required to debug specific problems, understand anomalies, and evaluate changing conditions or survey priorities.

In most cases, the different diagnostics will depend on a common set of data, including:
 - observatory telemetry
 - one or more baseline survey simulations
 - the record of the visits completed up to and including the most recent night (including data quality information)
 - simulations of the future of the survey, starting with the next night of observing.
 - previously completed survey simulations, starting after each completed night of observing.

In some cases, analysis for scheduling and survey strategy may use tools developed for other purposes, such as maintenance of the instrument itself (as specified in [[https://ls.st/lse-30][LSE-30]]/OSS-REQ-0067).
In other cases, analysis will require more flexible computation or access to data, including creation of custom scheduler simulations, access to archives of completed scheduler simulations, data management results, or even external data sources.
Once code for creation of a diagnostic is developed, the processes and tools used should support easy or automatic regeneration of the diagnostic.
When the creation is not computationally expensive, including it in a set of diagnostics to be automatically regenarated and posted nightly should be straightforward.
For computationally expensive diagnostics, inclusion in a set of diagnostics that can be repeated "on demand" should be similarly straightforward.

The set of tools available to the Survey Scientist, Survey Support Scientist, and the Survey Scheduling team should therefore include:
 - APIs that provide access to observatory telemetry, archives of survey simulations, and DM output from within a common environment. These tools will therefore require access to either the summit Engineering and Facilities Database (EFD, [[https://ls.st/sql-034][SQR-034]]) or the data management EFD (DM-EFD, [[https://ls.st/sqr-029][SQR-029]]) for the telemetry data, and the DM butler for access to DM output. Access to an archive of past =opsim= simulations and the metrics calculated from them will also be required. That can be achieved by any of several means, including a simple filesystem.
 - A computational environment that includes the analysis and tools needed for computing diagnosits (e.g. jupyter notebooks with environments that include =opsim=, =MAF=, and stardard python scientific libraries)
 - Tools for automatic execution of lightweight code written to calculate diagnostics.
 - Tools for on-demand execution of computationally expensive diagnostic calculation.
 - A tool for collection and presentation of calculated diagnostics.

In addition to reports, tools for monitoring performance ("dashboards") and interactive analysis are needed.
Some of the views of the data required will consist of simple values directly connected to data generated by the instrumentation of the observatory itself ("telemetry").
Such requirments include [[https://ls.st/lse-30][LSE-30]]/OSS-REQ-0067, "Performance & Trend Analysis Toolkit":

Requirement: The LSST Observatory shall be developed to allow an
observing scientist to have oversight of the Data Collection
process. This interaction shall be enabled either locally on the
summit or at remote locations. The data provided shall include all
observing condition data, telemetry data to assess telescope
conditions, and science data quality metrics for evaluation of the
data collection process.

Discussion: The objective of this requirement is to enable the
observing scientist to be involved directly in the observing
process. Under normal circumstances the observing scientist will not
intervene in the autonomous operations (LSR-REQ-0072), but should be
allowed to override if anomalous behavior occurs.
#+END_QUOTE

In other cases, the it is clear that tools that are limited to simple examinition of telemetry will not be sufficient.

tools to predict the final results of the ten year survey based on the

TODO discuss separation of telemetry and other metrics that need tools for exploration, and correspondance to LOVE and SQuaRE/SQuaSH, and implications for survey progress monitoring tool development.

** Periodic progress reports and performance reviews
The observatory staff and scheduling team will need to report progress and strategic concerns to management, funding agencies, and the community as a whole. Requirements for the existence of such reports are present in multiple plans and requirements documents. Some examples include [[https://ls.st/lse-29][LSE-29]]/LSR-REQ-0065, "Survey performance reviews," which states:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Observatory shall have the ability to provide periodic status reports on the progress of the survey to allow both operations staff and the community to assess the survey progress.
#+END_QUOTE
and [[https://ls.st/lse-30][LSE-30]]/OSS-REQ-0033, "Survey Planning and performance monitoring", calls out the need for reporting to the community at large:
#+begin_quote
The LSST shall provide the tools and administrative processes necessary to monitor the progress of the ongoing survey, provide reports on the progress of the survey, respond to feedback from the science community, and evaluate the impact of changing science priorities over the 10 year survey lifetime.

Discussion: It is expected that the performance of this task will require the use of detailed survey simulations in order to evaluate scheduling alternatives and optimize the future performance of the survey.

The [[https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-36797/Rubin%20Observatory%20Operations%20Plan%20April%202020.pdf][Rubin Observatory Operations Plan]] gives responsibility for producing a quarterly report to the Observatory Support Scientist:
#+begin_quote
Responsible for producing a quarterly report on the scheduled/expected observations versus the performed observations. This analysis includes monitoring the assumptions used by the scheduler including slew times, shutter open/close times, readout times etc. 
#+end_quote

Multiple such reports will be made on different schedules, customized for different audiences.
All of these reports may draw from any of the report elements descibed in section [[*Metrics, plots, and other diagnostics]], but it is unlikely that any single report will require every element.
While the generation of individual elements will benefit from automation, the compilation and construction of such reports will require human attention and customization to each audience.

** ABANDONED Weekly and monthly progress reports                   :noexport:
Among other duties, the "LSST Operations Plan" (LPM-73) specifies (section 8.3.3) that staff in Chile has the following telescope scheduling related duties:
 - Tracking survey progress relative to the science requirements.
 - Optimizing the scheduled observations.
 - Balancing the observing schedule between survey operations, diagnostic activities, and
calibration.
Furthermore, that the staff in Chile
#+begin_quote
Use the Operations Simulator toolbox to measure progress against the survey plan. A written monthly progress report will be provided to Headquarters, and weekly updates will be tracked in Chile. Adjustments to the short term observing plan (choice of filters, relative priority of science programs, etc.) will be made in Chile.

** ABANDONED Periodic performance reviews                          :noexport:
The observatory staff and scheduling team will need to report progress and strategic concerns to management, funding agencies, and the community as a whole.
These review may take the form of presentations (for example at the yearly Project and Community Workshop (PCW)) or written reports.
Current requirements as written acknoweldge the need for such reports, but do not significantly constrain their contents. 
[[https://ls.st/lse-29][LSE-29]]/LSR-REQ-0065, "Survey performance reviews," states:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Observatory shall have the ability to provide periodic status
reports on the progress of the survey to allow both operations staff

The reasonable contents of the reports will depend both on the venue and the state of the survey itself, and the reports themselves will require significant explanatory text and analysis: these reports are not a reasonable candidate for full automation.
However, many of the metrics and plots that will be contained in such reports are, and furthermore will usually be those already generated for Night reports (section [[*Night reports]]), weekly and monthly progress reports (section [[*Weekly and monthly progress reports]]), or generated by dashboards or using interactive debugging tools.

** Interfaces for education and public outreach
While many survey progress metrics and visualizations are only likely to be of interest to experts, several will be intuitive, and may be good candidates for engaging the general public, as per [[https://ls.st/lse-29][LSE-29]]/LSR-REQ-0113, "EPO Products, Tools, and Interfaces"
#+begin_quote
LSST EPO shall provide access to LSST data through tools, interfaces,
and learning experiences that are designedto engage communities with
different levels of knowledge, experience and skills.
#+end_quote
Good candidates for presentation to the public are movies of numbers of exposures generated, and plots numbers of galaxies (or other objects) detected as a function of time.

* Infrastructure needs
 - Data collection, storage, retrieval, and distribution :: Calculation of metrics and other diagnostics require a variety of data, including:
   + summit telemetry data :: Telemetry data will be stored in the summit EFD and also a DM-EFD. Access to either of these through an API should be sufficient for strategy, scheduler, and progress monitoring needs.
   + data management results :: Some metrics such as total counts of stars and galaxies will require access to the results of data management. The DM butler is one option for such access.
   + simulation results :: The progress monitoring infrastructure will need an archive of =opsim= simulations, to which new simulations may be stored and from which old ones may be retrieved. Such results could potentially be stored a combination of the DM butler, but mechanisms such as a simple filesystem are likely to be adequate.
   +  diagnostic results :: Metrics, plots, and other diagnostics will also need to be archived. These results could potentially be stored and and retrieved from the butler, and some of them may be suitable for a time series database such as that used by the EFDs, but such solutions may also be unnecessarily complex: a simple filesystem and small relational database are likely to be adequate for this task.
 - Data processing :: A handful of =opsim= simulations will need to be run after each night of observing, and a standard set of metrics calculated for them. Such simulations take a 6 to 8 hours to complete on 2020 hardware, so cannot be performed on demand. However, a simple single node with a cron job could adequately perform the task. 
 - Dashboards and report generation :: Mechanisms for preseting the generated diagnostics and metrics will be required. For sets that should be reviewed daily, diagnostics  should be presented in pre-made sets according to their usage, without a need for the user to select or customize plots each time. For example, plots needed for the night plan and night report should be presented web pages or report templates without the need for human interaction or customization.

* Available infrastructure
 - opsim :: The existing scheduler software product already supports creation of simulations, and such capabilities will be maintained thoughout the life of the survey.
 - The Metrics Analysis Framework (MAF) :: MAF provides a collection of tools in python for the analysis of scheduler simulation results, and the science collaborations have developed (and are continuing to develop) metric calculation tools within this framework. 
 - Engineering and Facilities Database (EFD) :: Observatory telemetry will be stored in EFDs. There are two EFDs under development: the summit EFD ([[https://ls.st/LTS-210][LTS-210]]) and the Data Management (DM) EFD ([[https://sqr-029.lsst.io/][SQR-029]]).  Data associated with validation of the site and telescope model used by the scheduler (section [[*Validation of the site and telescope model]]) will require access to one of these databases.
 - Data Management Butler :: The butler is the archiving and access tool that will be used by Data Management to store the results of processing. Calculation of several scheduler diagnostics will require access to this data. Examples include limiting magnitudes and other data quality measures and numbers of different types of objects detected (e.g. stars, galaxies). The butler appears to be flexibile enough to support storage of scheduler-related data sets, including the results of simulations themselves, but it is unclear that there are any advantages of storing such data in the butler rather than a simple file system.
 - Science Quality Analysis Harness (SQuaSH) :: SQuaSH ([[https://sqr-009.lsst.io/][SQR-009]]) provides infrastructure for monitoring data management pipeline tasks. This infrastructure has many features in common with what is required for scheduling and survey progress related tasks. Elements of the SQuaSH infrastructure include (shown in the architecture diagram in SQR-009):
   + execution environment :: SQuaSH includes a verification job execution environment.
   + time series database :: SQuaSH seems to be built around the assumption that each metric is best examined as a time series of scalar values. This is true for many progress and scheduling related metrics, but there are important exceptions, such as depth maps or distributions. 
   + metric visualization :: SQuaSH includes an instance of [[https://docs.influxdata.com/chronograf/v1.8/][chronograph]], a timeseries visualization tool designed to work with the selected implementation of the time series database, [[https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/][InfluxDB]]. It seems likely that this tool would be useful for visualization of many of our time series metrics, but may lack the specialized visualizations present in existing tools like MAF, such as hourglass plots.
   + external dashboards :: 
   + Nublado :: 
   + nbreport :: SQuaRE includes infrastructure for running jupyter notebooks as templates for periodic reports, and uses the night report as a reference example ([[https://sqr-026.lsst.io/][SQR-026]]). This system might be suitable for generation of the night plan, and as reports that can serve as first drafts for longer, less frequent reports.
   + S3 datastore :: 
 - faro ::
 - LOVE ::
 - Observatory Logging Ecosystem ::
